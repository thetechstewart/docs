Get published by Linode and get paid! Earn $250 per article if it's accepted for publication.

We're expanding the Linode Guides & Tutorials, and we want you to help! If you like writing, teaching people how to use Linux, and money, we want to hear from you. The guidelines are below.

## Topic List

Submit your own topic, or choose from the list of open topics we want to add to the Linode Library:

-   [OpenChange](http://www.openchange.org/)
-   [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org/)
-   Gaming Servers
-   [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home)

Each article is worth $250 if it is accepted for publication. In addition, we always welcome edits, suggestions, and updates to existing guides.


## How Much Money Will I Earn?

We will pay you $250 per article that is accepted for publication in cash via PayPal, or as Linode credit. Note that submitting an article is not a guarantee of publication. After you submit it, we will let you know if your article has been accepted.

## Write Your Article

Use the [style guide](/docs/style-guide). While you're writing, make sure your content is:

-   Accurate. Your instructions should be straightforward and technically accurate.
-   Detailed. Your content should include detailed explanations of each step taken, to familiarize readers with the purpose behind each step.
-   Formatted. Your style should use [PHP Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) formatting and match the Linode Library [style guide](/docs/style-guide).
-   Original. Your content should be original material written for Linode. We will not accept submissions that have been copied from other sources.

Want to make sure you don't waste time writing a long article we can't use? Submit a writing sample first to <contribute@linode.com>.

## Submit Your Article

Submit your article as a [pull request on GitHub](http://www.github.com/linode/docs), or by emailing it to <contribute@linode.com> as a plain text or Markdown file attachment. Writing samples are welcome as well.

Got images? Attach them as **.png** or **.jpg** files. If an image is over 650 pixels wide, please send both the original and a 650-pixel-wide version.

Submission checklist:

-   Article in **.txt** or **.md** format
-   Images
-   Your name, as you want it to appear in the Library
-   PayPal account information, or Linode account information for Linode credit

Once you've submitted your article, here's what you can expect:

1.  You'll receive a brief response acknowledging your submission.
2.	If not already submitted through GitHub, most articles will be added for community review for a period of about one week.
3.	After the initial one to two week period of review, your article will be accepted or rejected.
4.  If accepted, we will do a technical review of your material. This will take a few days.
5.  We will do a copy edit of the article. This will take a few days.
6.  You may receive questions or comments from us, or a request for a resubmission with a few changes.
7.  We will then send you the final version of the article before publication. You will have 36 hours to respond and approve our publication of the final version.
8.  If you respond positively (non-response will be taken as a go-ahead to publish), we will publish the article and give you the cash or Linode credit.
