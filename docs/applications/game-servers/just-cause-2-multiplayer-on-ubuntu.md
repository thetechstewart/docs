Just Cause 2 is a single player game published by Square Enix. As it has no multiplayer mode, the modding community has created a multiplayer mod for the game and is quite popular. This guide will explain how to prepare your VPS, install SteamCMD, and install, then configure, Just Cause 2's Multiplayer Mod.

## Prerequisites

Have the following items before you begin:

- A [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com) account.
- A copy of [Just Cause 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/8190/) that you have purchased on Steam.
- A copy of the [Just Cause 2 Multiplayer Mod](http://store.steampowered.com/app/259080/) that has been added to your steam library.
- An up-to-date Linode running Ubuntu 14.04. We suggest you follow our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide for help configuring your Linode.

>This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If you’re not familiar with the sudo command, reference the [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.

## Preparing your Linode

Just Cause 2 is sold on Steam, as is its multiplayer mod. Therefore, we will use SteamCMD to download and maintain servers for games sold on steam.

Because current generation Linodes run a 64-bit operating system, we need to download a few extra libraries in order to run SteamCMD.

1.  Configure the package manager to include packages for i386 architecture:

        sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386

2.  Update the system:

        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

3.  Install the 32-bit libraries required:

        sudo apt-get install lib32gcc1 lib32stdc++6 libc6-i386 libcurl4-gnutls-dev:i386 screen

    {: .note }
    > If you're running a legacy Linode on a 32 bit kernel, install these packages instead:
    >
    >     sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev:i386 libc6-i386 libgcc1 screen

If you have a firewall running on your Linode, add exceptions for SteamCMD:

    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp -m udp --sport 4380 --dport 1025:65355 -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp -m udp --sport 10999 --dport 1025:65355 -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp -m udp --sport 7777 --dport 1025:65355 -j ACCEPT

{: .note }
> If you've configured your firewall according to our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) guide, be sure to add these port ranges to your `/etc/iptables.firewall.rules` file.

## Install SteamCMD and Don’t Starve Together

1.  From your user's home folder, download SteamCMD into its own directory:

        mkdir steamcmd
        cd steamcmd
        wget http://media.steampowered.com/installer/steamcmd_linux.tar.gz

3.  Extract the package and remove the archive file:

        tar -xvzf steamcmd_linux.tar.gz
        rm steamcmd_linux.tar.gz

4.  Run the SteamCMD Installer.

        ./steamcmd.sh

    This command will display output similar to this:

        Redirecting stderr to '/home/linode/Steam/logs/stderr.txt'

        Steam>

    The `Steam>` prompt is similar to the linux command prompt, with the exception of not being able to execute normal linux commands. 

4.  Install JC2-MP from the SteamCMD prompt:

        login anonymous
        force_install_dir ../jc2mp-server
        app_update 261140 validate

    This can take some time. If the download looks as if it has frozen, be patient; it may take about 10 minutes. Once the download is complete, you should see this output:

        Success! App '261140' fully installed.

        Steam>

5.  Finally, exit SteamCMD.

        quit

##Configuring Just Cause 2-Multiplayer

1.  Before you configure JC2-MP, make a copy of the default configuration file:

        cd ~/jc2mp-server
        cp default_config.lua config.lua

2.  Open the configuration file with your preferred text editor to modify the configuration. Each server option is explained in the configuration file.

3.  When you are finished, save and exit your text editor.

##Using the Server

1. Before starting up the server for the first time, it is good to symlink a library file to avoid a possible error:

        cd ~/jc2mp-server
        ln -s ~/steamcmd/linux32/libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6

2.  To start the server, simply run the executable. 
        screen ./Jcmp-server
        
3.  To detach from the screen session running the server console, press these two key combinations in succession:

    **CONTROL + A**
    **CONTROL + D**

4.  To bring the console back, type the following command:

        screen -r

5.  To stop the server, bring back the console and press **CONTROL + C**.

## Entering The Server

Now that you have installed and configured Just Cause 2-Multiplayer, you have your very own Just Cause 2 server for you and your friends to play on. Your users can access the server by opening the server list and finding your server’s name, clicking **Connect**, and entering a password if you choose to set one.
